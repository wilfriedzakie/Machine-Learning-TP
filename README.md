# Machine-Learning-TP

This project is the application of  3 machine learning classifiers (KNN, SVM and Naive bayes) on the famous Iris dataset. 

Using a jupyter notebook the following tasks have been written in python:

1 - Evaluate and write errors of the 3 classifiers of the classifier 

2 - What is the optimal parameter k of the k-nearest-neighbor classifier for this dataset?

3 - Compare evaluation results of the three classifiers
